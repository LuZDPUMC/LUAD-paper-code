This comprehensive R script pipeline is designed to analyze gene expression differences between normal and tumor tissues (LUAD) using integrated GTEx and TCGA data. The workflow consists of four major steps: (1) Data arrangement: The expression matrix was preprocessed by removing genes with low expression (expressed in less than 50% of samples), imputing missing values using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and averaging duplicated genes. The data were then log2-transformed to reduce variance and approximate normality, and a curated list of genes of interest was used to extract a refined expression matrix for downstream analysis. (2) Differential expression analysis: Differential expression between normal tissues (n = 347) and tumor tissues (n = 515) was assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For each gene, the mean expression, log fold change (logFC), p-value, and median difference were calculated. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to control for multiple testing. Genes with an absolute logFC > 1 and FDR < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. The complete results were saved as all.xls, and the list of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was saved as diff.xls. A matrix containing expression values of significant DEGs (diffGeneExp.txt) was prepared for visualization. (3) Heatmap visualization: A ranked transformation was applied to the expression matrix of significant DEGs to normalize value distribution before visualization. The pheatmap package was used to generate a heatmap with sample type annotations (normal vs tumor), and the final heatmap was saved as a PDF file. (4) Volcano plot visualization: The DEG data were further visualized using a volcano plot to highlight significantly upregulated and downregulated genes. Genes were categorized as "Up", "Down", or "Not" based on logFC and FDR thresholds. The plot was created using ggplot2 and exported as a PDF.
